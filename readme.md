# Overview

The project is a React Native app for tracking daily activities. It aims to provide users with an easy way to keep track of their daily tasks and progress towards their goals.

# Get Started

To run the app in your local environment, please follow the instruction:

1. Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:kabaljit/factorialHr.git`
2. Open the project directory: `cd factorialHr`
3. Install the packages: `yarn`
4. Start the development server: `yarn dev`
5. If you want to run the app on a simulator or emulator:
   - Pressing `a` will open in an Android Emulator or connected device.
   - Pressing `i` will open in an iOS Simulator.
   - Pressing `w` will open in a web browser. Expo supports all major browsers.

## Note

- To simplify the routes and to not use relative paths, I am using alias for `Domain` and `lib`
- I use a template engine to maintain consistency in your codebase, reducing repetition, and improving productivity in my development process.
